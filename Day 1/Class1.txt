Variable : It can be defined as a name given to memory location to store the value in it. The
value of a variable may vary during the execution of the program.
 
a = 10
a = a+10
 
x = 10.5
 
x = "Wipro"
 
y = 100
Y = 200
 
constant: We cannot change the value of a constant variable during the execution of the program.
 
Keywords: They are also called as reserved words which have special meaning given to it. All the keywords in python are in lowercase except 3 keywords that is True , False and None.
 
Data Type: It is used to specify which type of data the variable will store.
 
Identifiers: It is a set of rules we have to follow while giving the name to a variable , function , class , object and so on.
 
a) It should always start with alphabet or _
 
Example:
ab1 Valid
1ab Invalid
_ab Valid
a_b Valid
a Valid
 
b) Only Underscore(_) special character is allowed.
 
Example:
a_b valid
a$b Invalid
_ Valid
 
c) Keywords cannot be used as an identifier
 
Example:
if Invalid
if_ Valid
for Invalid
_for Valid
 
d) It can be of any length
 
 
Functions:
 
a) built in function:
input( ): It is used to accept the value from the user and input() always accept the value in
the form of String.
 
 
print( ):
 
b) user defined function:
 
Comments:
 
Single Line Comment: #
 
MultiLine Comment: start with ''' and end with '''




FUNCTION - 
In Python Function in define in module
Two types of fn - 
1.) Built-In Function -
    ex. - print(),input()
2.) User Defined Function





- Write an algorithm to calculate the factorial of a number
 
Solution:
 
Step 1) Start
 
Step 2) Declare i=1 , n , fact = 1
 
Step 3) Read/Accept n
 
Step 4) if i<=n then goto next step

	else goto step 7
 
Step 5) fact= fact * i		
 
step 6) i = i+1 and goto step 4
 
step 7) print fact
 
step 8) Stop

# Write an algorithm to print the factors of a number
# Write an algorithm to print the multiplication table of a number
