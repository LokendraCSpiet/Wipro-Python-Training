Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations
1) Check whether number is Disarium number or not
    Hint:
    175 = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175
    135 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135
2) Check whether number is special number or not
    Hint: Sum of factorial of each digit = Number
    145 = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
3) Print the fibonacci series upto n
    n = 10
    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations on the string.
1)Check whether the number is pronic number or not
    Hint: Pronic number is the number which is the product of two consecutive integers.
    Examples:   12 = 3 * 4
                20 = 4 * 5
                42 = 6 * 7
2)Check whether the number is a Niven number or not.
    Niven number: A number is said to be Niven which is divisible by the sum of its digits.
    Example:    126
                Sum of its digits = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 and 126 is divisible by 9.
3)Check whether the number is Armstrong number or not.
    Armstrong number: A number is said to be Armstrong if sum of cube of each digit is equal to number
    Example:    153
                1 + 125 + 27 = 153
4)Exit

Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations
1) check whether the number is palindrome or not
2) Accept the number from the user and display the sum of even digits and odd digits from a number
    Example:    193024
                Sum of odd digit is 13
                Sum of even digit is 6
3) Program to accept the number of rows and print the following pattern:
    1 2 3
    1 2
    1
4) Exit
