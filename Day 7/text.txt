--------------------------

class:
A class can be defined as a collection of data members and member function.
 
Syntax:
class classname:
	# Member function and data member of the class
 
 
object:
It is used to access the data members and to invoke the member functions of the class.
Once the class is created we can create N number of objects of the same class.
 
How to create the object ?
objectname = classname()
 
How to invoke the member function of the class?
objectname.functionname( )
 
Special member function ?
 
__init__( ): This function will be invoked automatically when the object of the class is created. It is used to initialize the data members/object of the class.
